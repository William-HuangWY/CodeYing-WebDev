# Testing Area

This directory serves as the testing ground for various components related to the development of the CodeYing project. Here, I experiment with different features and functionalities before integrating them into the main application.

## Structure

The `test_area` folder contains several files and subdirectories that are organized to facilitate testing of various components, such as navigation bars, sidebars, and other UI elements.
